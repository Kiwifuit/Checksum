usage.exitCodeList.0: 0: Successful Execution. This means everything went well,
usage.exitCodeList.1: 1: Big Oopsie. This means something went wrong. Stack Trace is printed instead of the normal output,
usage.exitCodeList.2: 2: Missing Parameter. It's self explanatory: you missed a required parameter,
usage.exitCodeList.3: -100: Internal Oopsie. This means that a subclass has not implemented its call() method. This is very nerdy so you probably won't encounter it
